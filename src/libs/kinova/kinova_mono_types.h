/** Representing a class.
 * Each class from the C# library that we want to provide for the CPP API should be
 * derived from this class, with
 *   class MyClass : public KinovaMonoClass<MyClass>
 *
 * This is a class template, in order to allow each derived class to have independent
 * static members. As we will have a derived class for each C# class that we want to
 * provide, this saves a lot of repetitive code.
 *
 * The init-function is basically a call to the derived class's init-function. This
 * has two reasons:
 * 1) Each derived class has own private members that need to be initialized, which
 *    cannot be done here, as we don't have (and don't want to have) knowledge about
 *    those classes here .
 * 2) The initialization procedure for __class is allways the same, which suggest to
 *    write it here in this template's member function. However, that requires code
 *    from mono, which would need an inclusion of a mono-header in this header file,
 *    which again means that the user needs to consider mono CFLAGS/LIBS in the compiler
 *    (which we want to avoid; see commit log).
 *    Although that's just 2 lines of code, with increasing amount of classes it would
 *    be nice to even avoid repetition of those 2 lines. Still looking for a nice solution
 *    for this....
